So I've listened today to a few talks from IOG about Midnight and it's super easy to interpret between the lines all the work done, as I've been substantially playing with blockchain creation and zkps.
It's really hard for me not to feel like Midnight is just a Subtrate blockchain which you can spin in 30min with zkp circuit library atop which there are many of - we've got even one on Cardano as of recent.
So, a lot of hand waving and shitting on Cardano, but really it is just a subset of Cardano (at least at the current stage and for the next few years). I've heard they've had to write 200k lines of code for Midnight, but I'm yet to hear what these lines do. All they talk about is out of box Subtrate and as many other zkp circuit libs.
I know from a friend who worked on a project from the beginning that they've been working on it for less than 3 years, so they're stretching the story counting it down from some old paper they wrote.
It's clearly way from being ready, likely 2-3 years, as dev net is planned for March, which even isn't testnet, which means it doesn't even work well yet. Which NB is shitty progress from Edinburgh Workshop team attended where they even couldn't start it for the demo and dev workshop.
It's as basic as it gets, and you could have Midnight on Cardano in 6 months, instead of separate chain, but I guess it's bad for the bottom line, so they don't do that.
So much bs, that it is unreal. Sorry had to write it somewhere and thought I'm going to pour my annoyance with them here instead on Discord where it can leak onto Twitter, and why to deal with unnecessary hostility later
